# Roblox-Filter-Bypass
Bypass the roblox forum filter with weird characters.

Adds a second post button when replying to roblox forum threads. This button makes all text in your post weird characters so it's suggested you only use it when it is absolutely necessary. Please don't be stupid and swear, I made this to bypass the dumb filtering, not to encourage children to embarrass themselves.

Known bugs:

--sometimes in weird cases it'll still filter the message. When this happens the message will not post so don't worry you have a chance to rephrase it. This appears to be because of the lowercase a character I'm using so I'll try to fix it soon. One example of this is any time you write lowercase 'az' it filters the entire message. 
Sorry about that!

Planned features:

--Filter bypass when creating a new thread
