# Roblox-Filter-Bypass
Bypass the roblox forum filter with weird characters.

Adds a second post button when replying to roblox forum threads. This button makes all text in your post weird characters so it's suggested you only use it when it is absolutely necessary. Please don't be stupid and swear, I made this to bypass the dumb filtering, not to encourage children to embarrass themselves.

Known bugs:

--Certain characters aren't perfect size. Capital A is too small, lowercase m/r too small.

Planned features:

--Filter bypass when creating a new thread
--Only change the filtered words (characters?) to weird unicode characters
